# foundry-counter

Using Foundry and Nader Dabit's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelA2U9TbgM&t=1s), created a smart contract that includes increment and decrement functions. Additionally with Foundry, compiled, tested, and deployed both locally and to the Goerli testnet. The testnet contract can be found on the [Goerli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa467d7526a9f955fdae1863554d2a09cf8f3ddab).
